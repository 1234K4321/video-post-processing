Build a web platform using LiveKit Cloud in Typescript where there is video streaming of user's webcam and start/end buttons, and all sessions are recorded and the video/audio/transciprts files are all extracted and saved into AWS S3 bucket (use the .env variables for S3/SQL/LiveKit details), and a few things are done:
1. in realtime, any safety violations are flagged (type, score) including: suspicious behaviour, AI bot, nudity, offensive, harassment, violence, etc. this part must use in-built typescript packages or open-source huggingface models or groq/llama (keep it simple/fast for now, the most important one is nudity).
2. after a session has ended (button, tab closed, max 10min by default), some engagement and quality scores are measured using reasoning gemini API call on the video/audio/transciprts files. engagement scores calculate: talk time/turns, interruptions/overlaps, gaze/eye contact, user front face presence, voice prosody, unnatural conversation etc. and quality scores calculate: video res, fps, artifacts/noise/motion blur/... and audio SNR (signal-to-noise), volume consistency, clipping, etc. it should flag if any of the metrics are too bad based on a threshold for each and also report a final combined score.
store all metrics in the S3 bucket.
make sure to fully separate the app interface and the video processing code folders. so both video processing above must be reusable even if the app interface changes to two users getting matched and video calling over a single session. It should be done for each user without changing the video processing code folder.
also add a README, instruction for deployment both on localhost and vercel, package requirements, and how to run the platform.
